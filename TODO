TODO:

    - Improve Color Contrast/Clarity

    - Meters (VU, Peak, etc.)

    - Drop-down Menus

    - HackAudio::Diagram::Junction Symbols

    - HackAudio::Viewport Possible Custom Scrollbars

    - Correct Diagram/Viewport Connection Bezier Distance (Should Draw Two Lines If Component Too Far, With The Second Being Straight)

    - Allow Junctions To Connect On Top/Bottom As Well (Y Bounds Checking)

BUG:

    - Indicator And Pip Sizes Don't Change With Slider Resizing

    - Occasionally Labels Animate Upon Opening The Editor In A Plugin
