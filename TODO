TODO:

	- Set Rotary Knob Angle Min/Max as Globals

	- Animate Pips on Rotary Value Change

	- Dijkstra Implementation for HackAudio::Diagram

	- Adjust Pip Min/Max Size Based On Number of Pips and Available Space



BUG:

	- Pip Mouse Hit-Testing Becomes Less Accurate With Increased Pip Count

	- Rotary Pip Location Setting is Currently Off By 1 (See Angle Range of Pips vs. Angle Range of Indicator)

	- Investigate Juce 30fps Graphics Limitations
